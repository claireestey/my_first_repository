# My First Repository

***

This is my first repository. Within the project, raw, unprocessed data goes in the 'data_raw' folder, manipulated data goes in the 'data' folder, figures and plots I generate are saved in the 'figures' folder, table I generate are saved in the 'tables' folder, my scripts (as rmarkdown files) are in the 'rmarkdown' folder, and the final paper will be in the 'paper' folder. 

# My Research Interests

***

For my MSc research, I am looking at the effects of **quaternary ammonium compounds** (QACs) on the diversity, community composition, and reproductive rates of freshwater zooplankton. Zooplankton are micro-crustaceans that live pelagically in the water column of lakes and oceans, typically feeding on phytoplankton or other zooplankton. QACs are a class of high-production volume chemicals that have a wide variety of uses, including as anti-static agents, disinfectants, and emulsifiers. The QAC I study in particular is called **benzalkonium chloride** (BAC) and is a potent antimicrobial compound. It's use since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased *drastically*, resulting in concerning levels being found in our freshwater systems, with unknown effects on aquatic biota. 

# Favourites

## Favourite Music

My five favourite songs are as follows:

1. *Jackie and Wilson* by Hozier 
2. *August* by flipturn
3. *Heat Above* by Greta Van Fleet 
4. *And She Was* by Talking Heads
5. *Going Gets Tough* by The Growlers 

## Favourite Equation

My favourite equation is the Inverse Simpson Index ($^2D$, where $S$ is species richness and $p_i$ is the proportion of individuals belonging to species $i$) as it is used in my research as a measure of zooplankton community diversity: 

$$
^2D = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^S(p_i)^2}
$$
